Continuous Imaging 'fly'
Copyright (C) 2008-2012  David Lowy & Tom Rathborne

SYNOPSIS

The 'prep' directory contains a set of Perl and shell scripts which
use metapixel <http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/metapixel/>
to create a mosaic for each of a set of images, made up of all of the
images. A thumbnail is generated for each image, and a db file stores
the mosaic reference information.

'fly' is a C OpenGL program which reads a db file and loads its
associated thumbnail JPEG images into texture memory, and lets you
lets you use your mouse to fly through the described mosaics in
realtime.

Makefiles are provided for Linux and MacOSX.
See INSTALL for dependency details.
